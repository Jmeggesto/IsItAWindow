# IsItAWindow
*Bleeding edge window-detection software for window connoisseurs*

##What It's All About

Is It A Window is a social window detection engine that allows users to take photos and submit them to the community to judge whether or not that photo is of a window. Photos have a Window Percentage to represent whether or not it is a picture of a window.

##Our Philosophy

This app seeks not to allow users to simply determine whether something is a physical glass window or not - it allows users to define *what a window is*. The meaning of a word should not be determined based on historical meaning or the traditional evolution of language - words and concepts should be open-source, for everyone to define.
